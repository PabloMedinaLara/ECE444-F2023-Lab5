# ECE444-F2023-Lab5

## Unit Test:

Added a test test_events_page() in /web_app/tests/views_test.py

## Pros and cons of TTD

### Pros

  - Tests are written before the code leading to higher quality code

  - Writing tests first helps improve the overal design my breaking it down into the indivudual features tested

  - Quicker iterating as bugs are more quickly detected and fixed

  - Easier maintenance as everything is modular

  - Tests work as documentation


### Cons

  - Requirement changes are more time consuming

  - Takes time to write and maintain the test cases

  - Not guaranteed to catch all bugs
